# Food-Management-System

The purpose of this project is to develop a computerized system that can be used to revolutionize the traditional ordering system. Till date a lot of restaurants make use of the manual ordering system which means all the work and procedure is recorded through manpower. It also consists of a great amount of paper being used which does not prove very effective and efficient. This often causes trouble to businesses due to human errors in most of the routines. Thus, this computerized system is designed to help businesses in their daily operations offering better management. This system is specifically designed for small and medium enterprise food industries. 
We chose the throwaway prototyping methodology for this project because a majority of the targeted users do not possess experience in working with computerised systems for orders. Therefore, through this methodology we as developers can communicate with the target users by using prototypes. This lets the target users review, evaluate, visualise and learn about the system before the system is finally implemented. Furthermore, this is a cross-platform system.This system is not just limited to desktops. It also works with mobiles and tablets. Hence, highlighting portability and mobility which is  a current trend. This reduces the chances of miscommunication between the restaurant management and their customers.
